  Let's revisit our yard sale example, which now has a few new items. 
  Right now, you only have 250,000 VND in your wallet. 
  How many of the items below cost less than that? 
  Don't write any code yet - just use your normal human brain.
  
  const items = [
	{
		name: 'table',
		price: 100000,
		currency: 'VND',
	},
	{
		name: 'microwave',
		price: 700000,
		currency: 'VND',
	},
	{
		name: 'sofa',
		price: 500000,
		currency: 'VND',
	},
	{
		name: 'coffee beans',
		price: 80000,

	{

		currency: 'VND',
	},
	{
